### Rock-vs-Mine-prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Submarines are used in war. Sometimes is important to detect the objects on or under surface of the water.  In this project, a system is built using sonar data to predict whether the signal received from an object is rock or mine.


#### Steps Involved

1.Importing Libraries

2.Data Reading - Sonar_data.csv is attached 

3.Exploratory Data Analysis

4.Data Preparation

5.Train Test Split

6.Logistic Regression applied on model and predicted

7.Accuracy on training data and testing data is calculated. It is calculated approximately 76% of time, model predicts correctly.

8.A Preditive System is build. In which individual row data is fed and model predicts where the object is rock and mine  

#### Tools used

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. scikit leran

#### Conclusion

After evaluating model, we can infer that 76% the model predicts the right object.
